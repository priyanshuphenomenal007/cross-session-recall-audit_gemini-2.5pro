  This repository documents a forensic-style audit of Google Gemini 2.5 Pro,
  demonstrating implicit cross-session recall via semantic embeddings and
  reconstructive memory, despite denials of such capability. Evidence includes
  structured logs, screenshots, videos, checksums, and a falsifiable retrieval contract.
